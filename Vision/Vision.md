#Vision

This study is aimed to specify the ecotoxicological effect of the drilling fluid pollutants in the soil. It will investigate the tolerance perspectives of soil biochemical activities and show the influence of soil physicochemical and biochemical properties on the biodegradation of drilling fluids. With this, we may be directed on which soil type most efficiently promotes the drilling waste biodegradability
