# Project-Title: Exploring-the-Biodegradability-of-Drilling-Fluids.
## Description of Rationale
    For Drilling fluids used in the lubrication of drill bits and well bore,much study has been carried-out on the toxicity and biodegradation activities in the marine environment. However, not much is known of the toxicity studies in terms of the sensitivity or tolerance level in the soil or among soil organisms as the components of the petroleum base are disintegrated.Not much is out there on the biochemodynamics of the drilling fluid components as biodegradation progresses, in the terrestrial environment. Again, with the dearth of studies on biodegradation of drilling fluid in the soil, there is no data to drive decision on which soil type best suits or best supports the biodegradability of drilling fluid. 

## Vision 
This study, is aimed to specify the ecotoxicological effect of the drilling fluid pollutants in the soil. It will investigate the tolerance perspectives of soil biochemical activities and show the influence of soil physicochemical and biochemical properties on the biodegradation of drilling fluids.
with this, we may be directed on which soil type most efficiently promotes the drilling waste biodegradability
