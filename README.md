All contributors and other potential community members are welcome to contribute and learn from this work. As time goes by, a channel for contributions would be created. But, for now, you can always add your comments or check the project issue link below.

## Issue on OLS-7 REPOSITORY
https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-7/issues/29

## Description of Rationale
    For ***Drilling fluids*** used in the lubrication of drill bits and well bore,much study has been carried-out on the toxicity and biodegradation activities in the marine environment. However, not much is known of the toxicity studies in terms of the sensitivity or tolerance level in the soil or among soil organisms as the components of the petroleum base are disintegrated.Not much is out there on the biochemodynamics of the drilling fluid components as biodegradation progresses, in the terrestrial environment. Again, with the dearth of studies on biodegradation of drilling fluid in the soil, there is no data to drive decision on which soil type best suits or best supports the biodegradability of drilling fluid. 

## Vision 
This study is aimed to specify the ecotoxicological effect of the drilling fluid pollutants in the soil. It will investigate the tolerance perspectives of soil biochemical activities and show the influence of soil physicochemical and biochemical properties on the biodegradation of drilling fluids. With this, we may be directed on which soil type most efficiently promotes the ***drilling waste biodegradability***

## The objectives

   To ascertain the effect of the Drilling fluid pollutant on the Soil physico-chemical properties 

	To ascertain the amount of total petroleum hydrocarbons introduced into the soil due to the presence of the base oil in the pollutant.

	To assay for the activity of Soil enzymes in order to ascertain the possible effect of the drilling fluid pollutants on the soil enzymes.

	To ascertain the amount of Heavy metals possibly introduced by the drilling fluid pollutants.


	To ascertain the microbial activity in the soil samples after the period of exposure

	To isolate and identify the drilling fluid degrading organisms in the different soils contaminated with drilling fluid pollutants.

	To ascertain the biochemodynamics of petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil samples (spiked with drilling fluid) as the study period progresses. 

## ROADMAP

As the problem defined previously, most drilling firms especially on-shore, prefer to use land spraying (or throwing) as a method of randomly disposing the waste drilling muds. No study yet states the soil type with better success for the biodegradation of drilling fluids by the metabolic activities of the indigenous soil organisms.
This is a brief description of the phases of this study. It pictures how the study will navigate from the beginning to the end.

### Stage 1 Procurement of Materials
Procurement and preparation of assay solutions and reagents and determination of access to facilities and equipment for the high throughput analysis in the study

### Stage 2 
Soil will be collected from three different locations representing three different soil types, into non-sterilized plastic containers using hand trowel. Soil material will be collected from the surface 0-20 cm of each site. The soil samples so collected shall be characterized for soil particle size, structure, water holding capacity and texture in order to identify and group them appropriately.
Initial soil physical activity analysis will be employed to determine the segregation of the soil samples into types.

### Stage 3 Soil Spiking
Soil spiking will be following the stainless-steel spoon method (Doick et al., 2003; Ramadass et al., 2015) with slight modifications.

### Stage 4 Analysis 
The exposure set-up stands for 28 days, after which the soil samples will be analysed for microbial activities, Soil physicochemical properties, Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), heavy metals and soil enzyme activities. This would be followed by analysis of the data collected during the laboratory observations and onward preparation of the report for presentation to the community and stakeholders. the analytical software and tools to be employed both for analysis and visualization of data will be decided as the data generation begins
