# Project-Title: Exploring-the-Biodegradability-of-Drilling-Fluids.
## Welcome Statement
Hello,
I am excited to welcome you to this open repository of our project. I am C. U. Ogbonna, an academic and researcher interested in Environmental pollutants and emerging anthropogenically generated chemical, their toxicological possibilities and remediation pathways.
All contributors and other potential community members are welcome to contribute and learn from this work. As time goes by, a channel for contributions would be created. But, for now, you can always add your comments or check the project issue link below.

## Issue on OLS-7 REPOSITORY
https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-7/issues/29

## Description of Rationale
    For Drilling fluids used in the lubrication of drill bits and well bore,much study has been carried-out on the toxicity and biodegradation activities in the marine environment. However, not much is known of the toxicity studies in terms of the sensitivity or tolerance level in the soil or among soil organisms as the components of the petroleum base are disintegrated.Not much is out there on the biochemodynamics of the drilling fluid components as biodegradation progresses, in the terrestrial environment. Again, with the dearth of studies on biodegradation of drilling fluid in the soil, there is no data to drive decision on which soil type best suits or best supports the biodegradability of drilling fluid. 

## Vision 
This study is aimed to specify the ecotoxicological effect of the drilling fluid pollutants in the soil. It will investigate the tolerance perspectives of soil biochemical activities and show the influence of soil physicochemical and biochemical properties on the biodegradation of drilling fluids. With this, we may be directed on which soil type most efficiently promotes the drilling waste biodegradability

## The objectives

   To ascertain the effect of the Drilling fluid pollutant on the Soil physico-chemical properties 

	To ascertain the amount of total petroleum hydrocarbons introduced into the soil due to the presence of the base oil in the pollutant.

	To assay for the activity of Soil enzymes in order to ascertain the possible effect of the drilling fluid pollutants on the soil enzymes.

	To ascertain the amount of Heavy metals possibly introduced by the drilling fluid pollutants.


	To ascertain the microbial activity in the soil samples after the period of exposure

	To isolate and identify the drilling fluid degrading organisms in the different soils contaminated with drilling fluid pollutants.

	To ascertain the biochemodynamics of petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil samples (spiked with drilling fluid) as the study period progresses.
